# Guava and Guice

All of the jclouds framework is built on top of Guava and Guice.  The purpose of this document is not to instruct you on how to use Guava and Guice, but
rather serves as a pointer for you to find information.

## Guava

Guava fills in the gaps for Java.  It helps you to work with Java more efficiently.

Guava makes it easy for Java software engineers to follow best practices in Java 1.5 and beyond.  
It's a set of libraries that jclouds depends on as a primary dependency.

Several good resources exist for information on Guava.  We recommend that you read the book <it>Effective Java</it> by Josh Block.
