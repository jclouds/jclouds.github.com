Release Notes for jclouds Version 1.5
=========================

## Introduction

The release of jclouds Version 1.5 is the result of a collaboration between the jclouds team and our contributors. There are some notable
updates in Version 1.5 that our users have been requesting.  It is recommended that you upgrade to jclouds Version 1.5 if you are
still using jclouds Version 1.4.

A total of [70 Issues](http://code.google.com/p/jclouds/issues/list?can=1&q=Milestone%3D1.5.0+status%3AFixed+&colspec=ID+Type+Status+Priority+Milestone+Owner+Summary&cells=tiles)
were addressed between jclouds Version 1.4 and the current iteration of jclouds Version 1.5.

For further details, please see the [Javadoc for jclouds Version 1.5](http://demobox.github.com/jclouds-maven-site-1.5.0/1.5.0/jclouds-multi/apidocs/).  Release notes and Javadocs 
are also available for past versions of jclouds are also available in the [Release Notes archive](/documentation/releasenotes/).

## Notable Updates in jclouds Version 1.5 
Many of you have been awaiting (or helping build) massive new support for OpenStack based clouds.  There's even more, such as our new [Jenkins Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jclouds-plugin) and [command-line utility](https://github.com/jclouds/jclouds-cli).  Notables below.

### New and Updated Apis and Providers
*  New `openstack-keystone` and  `openstack-nova` apis for [OpenStack](http://openstack.org/) (Essex)
*  New `swift-keystone` which retrofits our old `swift` api for use in OpenStack KeyStone environments.
*  New `hpcloud-compute` and `hpcloud-objectstorage` providers for [HP Cloud Services](/documentation/quickstart/hpcloud)
*  New `rackspace-cloudserver-us` and `rackspace-cloudservers-uk` providers for the [Rackspace open cloud](/documentation/quickstart/rackspace)
*  New `trystack-nova` provider for the free [TryStack](https://trystack.org/) cloud
*  New `sqs` api and `aws-sqs` provider for [Amazon SQS](/documentation/quickstart/sqs)
*  Refactored `cloudwatch` api and `aws-cloudwatch` provider and added metrics features
*  Updated `cloudstack` api for [CloudStack](http://cloudstack.org/) version  3.0
*  Updated `chef` api for [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/) 0.10; first release to maven central!
*  Updated `gogrid` to support [images](http://code.google.com/p/jclouds/issues/detail?id=851)

### Core Updates
*  New [Provider/ApiMetadata](http://code.google.com/p/jclouds/issues/detail?id=657&can=1&sort=-id&start=300) to get 
metadata associated with the provider or API being used internally in jclouds
*  New `ImageExtension`  in ComputeService for clouds that support creating images based on existing nodes
*  New [TemplateBuilderSpec](http://code.google.com/p/jclouds/issues/detail?id=938) for externalizing template configuration such as loginUser and imageId.
*  Refactored OSGi bundles so they no longer require fragments
*  New Api/AsyncApi naming conventions for Rest clients; formerly Client/AsyncClient. 
Formerly led to confusion especially when an api included `Client` features.  For example, if the class was formerly named ServerClient, it will now be called ServerApi.

### Other goodies
*  New [Jenkins Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jclouds-plugin): Supports ComputeService-based slaves and publishing artifacts to BlobStore containers
*  New [command-line utility](https://github.com/jclouds/jclouds-cli): Handy command-line utility for launching and destroying instances across cloud providers and APIs
*  Added [OpenShift](https://openshift.redhat.com/app/), [Cloud Foundry](http://www.cloudfoundry.com/), and [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) 
environments to the [TweetStore](https://github.com/jclouds/jclouds/tree/master/demos/tweetstore) demo 
*  Refactored our [Google App Engine demo](https://github.com/jclouds/jclouds/tree/master/demos/googleappengine) which works on OpenStack

## New Features to Watch in Labs

*  `openstack-glance`, `openstack-quantum`, `openstack-swift`, and `openstack-nova-ec2`: for [OpenStack](http://openstack.org/) (Essex)
*  `vcloud-director`: for [vCloud Director 1.5+](http://code.google.com/p/jclouds/issues/detail?id=830)
*  `virtualbox`: for [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
*  `fgcp`: for [Fujitsu Global Cloud Platform](http://www.fujitsu.com/global/solutions/cloud/solutions/global-cloud-platform)
*  `greenqloud-compute` and `greenqloud-storage`: for [GreenQloud](http://greenqloud.com/)
*  `joyentcloud`: for [Joyent](http://www.joyent.com/)
*  `abiquo`: for [Abiquo](http://www.abiquo.com)
*  `azure-management`: for [Windows Azure](http://www.windowsazure.com)
*  `hostedchef` and `privatechef` in the `jclouds-chef` repo: for [Hosted and Private Chef](http://www.opscode.com/hosted-chef/)
*  `nodepool`: for pooling and reusing existing nodes

Disclaimer:  These features are currently being developed and evaluated by our team and contributors.  We cannot guarantee forwards and backwards
compatibility for these features.

## Deprecated Components and Non-backwards Compatible Changes

*  Removed the hpcloud-objectstorage-lvs provider.  This has been replaced with the hpcloud-objectstorage provider.
*  Changed the authentication mechanism for HP Cloud.  The change for hpcloud-objectstorage, which is to use password authentication by default instead of 
access key, will cause issues with existing implementations.  
*  Replaced the class called ModifyRequest for users creating their own jclouds drivers.  The replacement for this class is HttpRequest.Builder.  This can 
be created from an existing request via request.toBuilder().
